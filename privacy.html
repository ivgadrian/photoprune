      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how PhotoPrune handles information when you use the PhotoPrune iOS app and this support website.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        PhotoPrune is designed to process your photos on-device. We do not run ads, we do not use third-party analytics or tracking SDKs, and we do not sell personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Access in the App</h2>
      <p>
        With your permission, PhotoPrune accesses your photo library so you can review photos and choose what to keep or delete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photo and metadata processing is performed on your device. PhotoPrune does not upload your photo library to our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
      <p>
        To provide app features, PhotoPrune stores limited app data locally on your device, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Session statistics (for example, removed/kept counts)</li>
        <li>Personal best values and streak-related app state</li>
        <li>Settings and locally cached identifiers used for queue/history behavior</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is stored locally (for example via iOS app storage/UserDefaults) and is not used for ad targeting.
      </p>

      <h2>Photo Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to delete photos in the app, deletion is requested through Apple Photos APIs with your granted permissions.
      </p>

      <h2>Support Form Data</h2>
      <p>
        If you contact us through the support form, you may provide your name, email, app/device details, and message content. This information is used only to respond to your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        The support form is delivered through FormSubmit, which acts as a form delivery processor.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We do not share personal data for cross-app or cross-site tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can deny or revoke photo access in iOS Settings at any time.</li>
        <li>You can stop using the support form if you do not want to provide contact information.</li>
        <li>You can remove app data by deleting the app from your device.</li>
      </ul>
