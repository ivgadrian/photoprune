# PhotoPrune Support Page

This folder is ready for GitHub Pages hosting.

## Files

- `index.html`: support and feedback form
- `thanks.html`: confirmation page after submit
- `styles.css`: page styles

## Form Delivery

The form posts to:

`https://formsubmit.co/ivangheorgheadrian@gmail.com`

FormSubmit usually sends an activation email on first submission. Approve that once so delivery starts.

## GitHub Pages

Publish this folder's repo to GitHub and enable Pages from the `main` branch root.
